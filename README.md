# ðŸ¦” Sonic AI Training â€“ Reinforcement Learning with PPO
This repository contains the code for training an AI to play Sonic the Hedgehog using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and deep reinforcement learning. The AI learns to navigate levels, optimize speed, and overcome obstacles through trial and error.
